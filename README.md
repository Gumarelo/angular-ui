# angular-ui
This repository contains a set of native AngularJS directives based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS.

<h3>Accordion</h3>
<p>The accordion directive builds on top of the collapse directive to provide a list of items, with collapsible bodies that are collapsed or expanded by clicking on the item's header.</p>

<h3>Alert</h3>
<p>Alert is an AngularJS-version of bootstrap's alert.</p>
<p>This directive can be used to generate alerts from the dynamic model data (using the <code>ng-repeat</code> directive);</p>
<p>The presence of the <code>close</code> attribute determines if a close button is displayed</p></div>

<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>There are two directives that can make a group of buttons behave like a set of checkboxes, radio buttons, or a hybrid where radio buttons can be unchecked.</p>
